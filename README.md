# Occurrence_counting_Turing_Machine
The program builds a turing machine based on the given pattern. As default, it finds occurrence amount of a pattern in a tape. Although the API is optimal to implement custom functions. Input range is any printable ASCII character (32 - 126)

# How it works
- Enter the pattern and the tape to pattern.txt and tape.txt
- Run Turing_machine.py
